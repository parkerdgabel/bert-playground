# K-BERT Hexagonal Architecture Integration Summary

## Overview

The K-BERT project has been successfully restructured to use hexagonal architecture (ports and adapters pattern) with dependency injection. This provides better separation of concerns, testability, and flexibility.

## Key Components

### 1. Core Infrastructure (`core/`)

- **Ports** (`core/ports/`): Define interfaces/contracts that the domain needs
  - `ComputeBackend`: Abstract compute operations (MLX)
  - `StorageService`: Abstract storage operations
  - `ConfigurationProvider`: Abstract configuration management
  - `MonitoringService`: Abstract logging/monitoring
  - `TokenizerPort`: Abstract tokenization

- **Adapters** (`core/adapters/`): Implement the ports
  - `MLXComputeAdapter`: MLX implementation of compute
  - `FileStorageAdapter`: File system storage
  - `YAMLConfigAdapter`: YAML configuration
  - `LoguruMonitoringAdapter`: Loguru-based monitoring

- **DI Container** (`core/di/`): Dependency injection
  - `Container`: Main DI container with service registration/resolution
  - Supports singleton, factory, and transient lifetimes

- **Bootstrap** (`core/bootstrap.py`): Application initialization
  - Sets up all dependencies
  - Configures the DI container
  - Initializes plugins and event system

### 2. Domain Layer

- **Models** (`models/`): BERT model implementations
- **Training** (`training/`): Training logic and orchestration
- **Data** (`data/`): Data processing and loading

### 3. Application Layer

- **Commands** (`training/commands/`, `cli/commands/`): Command pattern for operations
- **Services**: Application-level orchestration

### 4. Infrastructure Layer

- **CLI** (`cli/`): Command-line interface
- **Adapters** (`adapters/`): Secondary adapters for external systems

## Key Architectural Patterns

### 1. Dependency Injection

```python
from infrastructure.bootstrap import initialize_application, get_service
from infrastructure.ports.compute import ComputeBackend

# Initialize application
container = initialize_application()

# Get services
compute = get_service(ComputeBackend)
```

### 2. Port/Adapter Pattern

```python
# Port (interface)
class StorageService(Protocol):
    def save(self, path: Path, data: Any) -> None: ...
    def load(self, path: Path) -> Any: ...

# Adapter (implementation)
class FileStorageAdapter:
    def save(self, path: Path, data: Any) -> None:
        # Implementation using file system
```

### 3. Command Pattern

```python
class TrainCommand:
    def __init__(self, model_factory, dataset_factory, orchestrator):
        # Dependencies injected
        
    def execute(self, config):
        # Training logic
```

### 4. Event-Driven Communication

```python
from infrastructure.events.bus import get_event_bus
event_bus = get_event_bus()
event_bus.publish(TrainingStartedEvent(...))
```

## Migration Notes

### Entry Points

1. **Main Application**: `main.py` - New entry point with proper initialization
2. **Package Entry**: `bert_playground/__main__.py` - For `python -m bert_playground`
3. **CLI Entry**: `cli:main` - For the `k-bert` command

### Import Changes

- Most imports remain the same for end users
- Internal code should use dependency injection instead of direct imports
- Use `get_service()` to retrieve services

### Configuration

- Still uses YAML configuration files
- Configuration is now managed through the `ConfigurationProvider` port
- Supports environment variable expansion

## Benefits

1. **Testability**: Easy to mock any dependency
2. **Flexibility**: Swap implementations without changing domain code
3. **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns
4. **Extensibility**: Plugin system for custom components
5. **Observability**: Built-in monitoring and event system

## Current Status

### Working Components

- ✅ Core DI container and bootstrap
- ✅ Port/adapter infrastructure
- ✅ Event system
- ✅ Plugin system
- ✅ Basic service registration

### Integration Issues

Some components have import issues due to the refactoring. These need to be addressed:
- Data adapters trying to import non-existent `domain` module
- Some circular import issues

### Next Steps

1. Fix remaining import issues in adapters
2. Update all commands to use DI properly
3. Add more integration tests
4. Update documentation

## Example Usage

See `examples/simple_hexagonal_demo.py` for a working demonstration of the architecture concepts.

```bash
# Run the demo
uv run python examples/simple_hexagonal_demo.py
```

## Testing

Integration tests are available in `tests/integration/`:
- `test_simple_integration.py`: Basic bootstrap tests
- `test_bootstrap.py`: Comprehensive bootstrap tests
- `test_full_stack.py`: Full application stack tests
- `test_cli_integration.py`: CLI integration tests
